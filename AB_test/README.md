# Business Decision Project
## Datasets
### The following information was available:
- a brief description of hypotheses, user coverage, impact on users and resource costs for hypothesis testing on a 10-point scale
- on user purchases
- on user visits
## Цель 
To prioritize hypotheses on increasing profits and to analyze the results of the A / B test
## Задачи:
- To apply ICE, RICE frameworks to hypotheses
- To calculate indicators and create graphs:
   - cumulative indicators (revenue, average check) by groups
   - relative change in the cumulative average check of group B to group A
   - cumulative average orders per visitor by group
   - relative change in the cumulative average number of orders per visitor of group B to group A
- o create and study scatter plots for the number of orders by users and the cost of orders
- To calculate the 95th and 99th percentiles for orders per user and order value, select a boundary to detect anomalies
- To calculate the statistically significant difference in the average number of orders per visitor and in the average order check between groups based on "raw" data
- To calculate the statistically significant difference in the average number of orders per visitor and in the average check of the order between groups according to the "changed data" data
